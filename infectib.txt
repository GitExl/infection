Description             : UAC Research Base Delta has unexpectedly gone
                          dark. Delta base, situated in an undisclosed
                          location in the northern United States, is
                          tasked with experimenting on salvaged remnants
                          of the demon army that invaded Mars. Your job
                          is to find out what the hell happened and
                          at your own discretion, take care of whatever
                          evil is taking place there now.

                          This mapset should take around 60 minutes to
                          complete on Ultra-Violence, provided you don't
                          die too often. All maps were balanced to be
                          played in order, though pistol starts are
                          doable with some extra effort.

                          This was tested with GZDoom, DSDADoom and PrBoom+
                          UM. It should be playable in all limit removing
                          source ports that have support for MBF21,
                          DEHEXTRA and UMAPINFO. There are a few minor
                          enhancements available when playing in GZDoom
                          and in recent versions of Eternity.

                          Compared to the previous version, [...]

                          Enjoy!
