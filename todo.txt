- Test ammo & health with DSDADoom, probably need to slightly improve pistol starts on early maps
- Increase difficulty? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp0MNBft_ys e.a.
- Door combat is too easy?
- "Corruption" on Hanging Cyberdemon sprite
- Add new map utilizing corruption after teleport at the end of the corrupted area
- Re-record demos, at least the 3rd demo desyncs now
